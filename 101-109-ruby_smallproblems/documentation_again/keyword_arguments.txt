Q: What does the following code print?

5.step(to: 10, by: 3) { |value| puts value }

A:
The documentation for Numeric#step can be found here: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Numeric.html#method-i-step

It tells us that #step has the keyword arguments :by (default = 1) for increment step, and :to, for limit.
It also tells us that it starts with the given input, in our case 5, and then evaluates the block.

Therefore, our code will print: 5 \n 8
