Given the code:
  name = 'Bob'
  save_name = name
  name.upcase!
  puts name, save_name

We should expect the last line to print out:
  'BOB'
  'BOB'

This is because:
  1. `save_name` is pointing to `name`
  2. The #upcase! method is destructive to `name`
  3. Since `save_name` is still pointing to `name` and `name` changed in-place
     the code will print `BOB` \n `BOB`.
