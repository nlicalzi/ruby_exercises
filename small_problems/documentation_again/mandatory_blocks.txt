Q: How would you search the following Array to find the first element whose value exceeds 8? (Using Array#bsearch)

a = [1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19]

A:
Array#bsearch is a Ruby implementation of Binary Search, a search algorithm with O(log n) complexity.
Its documentation can be found here: https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Array.html#method-i-bsearch

The correct implementation would be:
a.bsearch {|x| x > 8 } => 11
