Given the following code:
  array1 = %w(Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo)
  array2 = []
  array1.each { |value| array2 << value }
  array1.each { |value| value.upcase! if value.start_with?('C', 'S') }
  puts array2

We should expect it to print:
  'Moe
  Larry
  CURLY
  SHEMP
  Harpo
  CHICO
  Groucho
  Zeppo'

This is because:
  1. The shovel operator adds each value from array1 to the end of array2. Each
  array is now pointing to the same string objects in memory (in the same order).
    1a. array1 looks like: Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo
    1b. array2 looks like: Moe Larry Curly Shemp Harpo Chico Groucho Zeppo

  2. Each value in array1 is up-cased if the value starts with 'C' or 'S'. Since
  our arrays are pointing to the same string objects in memory, as the loop through
  array1 #upcases! them in place, and the same objects are referenced by array2,
  we can expect our arrays to continue being the same.
    2a. array1 looks like: Moe Larry CURLY SHEMP Harpo CHICO Groucho Zeppo
    2b. array2 looks like: Moe Larry CURLY SHEMP Harpo CHICO Groucho Zeppo
