Q: How can you modify the below code to print only the public methods defined/overriden by the String class, and not Object/BasicObject/Kernel?

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect

A: 

The problem here is with the #public_methods method, which our String has inherited because the Object class is String's parent class.
Looking at the documentation for Object#public_methods, we see that there is a keyword argument :all which defaults to true.
If we set :all to false instead, only the methods in the receiver (in this case, String) will be listed.

s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods(all=false).inspect

We could just write s.public_methods(false).inspect since there's only one keyword arg, but I prefer verbosity in this case for clarity.
