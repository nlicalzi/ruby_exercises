Q: What will the following code print? 

def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
  p [a, b, c, d]
end

my_method(4, 5, 6)

A:

The code will print [4, 5, 3, 6], because Ruby allows default values to appear in the middle
of positional arguments, and fills the missing arguments from left to right. There are 2 args
without default values, so the interpreter knows that (given 3 input values), one default arg
will have its value overwritten (the left-most one). Therefore a is assigned to 4, b to 5,
c stays as 3, and d is assigned to 6.
